## How to use it

If you don't have a site yet create one with `hexo init` [hexo-cli](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-cli).

```sh
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
hexo init
```

Navigate to the directory you want to place the theme project in (most likely `themes/`).

```sh
# from the site root
cd themes

# make a new theme directory
mkdir my-theme
cd my-theme

# generate
slush hexo-theme
```

**It will not automatically overwrite an existing file. Overwrites are confirmed with the user.**

1. Check `_config.yml` in your **main blog directory**
  * Set `theme` property to your theme name, activating this theme
2. Check `_config.yml` in your **theme directory**
  * Change menu items if needed
  * Change stylesheet and scripts list if needed
3. Navigate to your main blog directory
4. `hexo server --debug`

## Hexo renderers

It might be necessary to goto the blog directory and install a specific renderer for the template language you have chosen. Swig are built into Hexo.

```sh
# templates
npm install hexo-renderer-ejs
npm install hexo-renderer-njks
npm install hexo-render-pug

# styles
npm install hexo-renderer-stylus
npm install hexo-renderer-less
npm install hexo-renderer-sass
```

### Development

It uses [livescript](http://livescript.net) to compile the `slushfile.js`. It's
handled automatically through the `dev` script.

```sh
# watch the files, re-compile, and test
npm run dev

# build before publishing
npm run prd

# clean up the test site
npm run clean
```

07/02/2018: I tried running this with node v10.x and it didn't work and I don't know why. The message is not helpful to me.

This version combination work as of 07/02/2018L

```
node -v
# v9.11.2
npm -v
# 5.6.0
gulp -v
# ... CLI version 2.0.1
# ... Local version 3.9.1
```
