## How to use it

If you don't have a site yet create one with `hexo init` [hexo-cli](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-cli).

```sh
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
hexo init
```

Navigate to the directory you want to place the theme project in (most likely `themes/`).

```sh
# from the site root
cd themes

# make a new theme directory
mkdir my-theme
cd my-theme

# generate
slush hexo-theme
```

**It will not automatically overwrite an existing file. Overwrites are confirmed with the user.**

1. Check `_config.yml` in your **main blog directory**
  * Set `theme` property to your theme name, activating this theme
2. Check `_config.yml` in your **theme directory**
  * Change menu items if needed
  * Change stylesheet and scripts list if needed
3. Navigate to your main blog directory
4. `hexo server --debug`

## Hexo renderers

It might be necessary to goto the blog directory and install a specific renderer for the template language you have chosen. Swig are built into Hexo.

```sh
# templates
npm install hexo-renderer-ejs
npm install hexo-renderer-njks
npm install hexo-render-pug

# styles
npm install hexo-renderer-stylus
npm install hexo-renderer-less
npm install hexo-renderer-sass
```

Know another template language hexo users need?

1. Fork
2. Copy an existing template directory
3. Port it to the new language
4. Test
5. Create pull request

### Development

```sh
# test the development build
# it's faster than prd script
npm run dev

# build before publishing
# prd = production build
npm run prd

# clean up the test site
npm run clean
```

`npm run prd` does everything needed:

+ clean
+ link
+ test

If you want to add a template language please copy one and port it so it keeps roughly the same structure.
